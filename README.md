# Dice-bot

This is my first discord's bot. I wanted to make a bot that can help me and my friends playing role playing game like Shadowrun.


## List of commands: 
- !roll You can roll one or more dice of one value like : !roll 2d6 -> you roll two 6 faced dice
- !sroll Here is the command for shadowrun dice. You choose the number of dice you roll and the number of dice that have to be 5+ to succes like : !sroll 16 5 -> it will roll 16 dice and see if you have at least 5 dice with a value of 5+ and tell you whether or not you succeed or fail
- !ping Send back a Pong!
- !say Repeat the same sentence
- !help Show a embed that list the commands the bot has and how to use them
